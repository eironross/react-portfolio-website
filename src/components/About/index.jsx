                    <h3>Hi, EveryoneðŸ‘‹</h3>
                    <p>I started learning programming about 2 years ago and used python to automate my work using libraries such as Selenium and Pandas. I wanted to learn to code to upskill myself and be part of the growing tech industry.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I'm attending a bootcamp to study about the web development. There is this coolness of being a web developer wherein you can combine the creativity and technical aspects in developing web applications. </p>
